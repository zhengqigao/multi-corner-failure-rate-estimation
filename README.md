# Multi-Corner Failure Rate Estimation

## 1. Instruction

We propose a multi-corner failure rate estimation algorithm. For more details, please refer to our paper published on IEEE TCAD ([see here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8883237)).

Note that the codes displayed here are slightly different from the algorithms written in the paper. The differences mainly include:

1) In Expectation-Maxmimizaion (EM), the update forumla is implemented slightly different.

2) We actually adopt a piecewise linear approximation in solving the optimization problem in EM.

These issues cannot be easily explained in several words. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me. Although it is highly possible that I also forgot the details. :-)
